# yourTRIP


yourTRIP is a travel website that provides eye-catching features for facilitating tourism. We aimed at developing a website that offers users an opportunity to book available tours and provide feedback on several tours. With a simple UI design and a limited set of features demonstrated on the website, yourTRIP as an academic project meets our expectations.
